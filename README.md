# ðŸŒ³ Treecle

Need to handle tree-like objects? Weâ€™ve got you covered!
**Work in progress, try at your own risk.**

</header>

<main>

Features:
- Tree-shakable
- No dependencies
- TypeScript support (WIP)

Utility functions for:
- Traversal
- Transformations
- Search

## Installation

```sh
npm install treecle
```

or

```js
import * as treecle from "https://treecle.mavo.io/dist/treecle.js";
```

Or import functions individually from `src`.

## Usage

For details on what functions exist and their signatures, see the [API docs](./docs/).

This page exposes a global `treecle` object for experimentation. Open the console and try things out!

### Data shape

Treecle is designed to work with tree-like objects, where nodes are objects and edges are properties.
Arrays are used to represent multiple children of a node.
Arrays of arrays have no meaning in such a structure.

However, these constraints are not enforced, and whenever it would not be costly in terms of performance, treecle does try to handle data gracefully.

### Parent pointers

Certain methods like `closest()` and `children.replace()` depend on *parent pointers*, i.e. being able to get from a node to its parent.
When Treecle traverses an object, it also stores a path from the object to its parent.
To avoid mutating the object, this is stored in a private `WeakMap`, but you can access it via `parents.path(node)`.
To ensure every node in a (sub)tree has a parent pointer, use `parents.update(root)`.

### Getting a nodeâ€™s children

By default, Treecle assumes that every property that points to an object is a parent-child relationship.
You can customize this by importing the `config` object and setting `config.getChildProperties` to a function that returns the child properties of a node as an array of strings.

You can also override `config.isNode(node)` to be more specific about what should be considered a node.
By default it considers all plain objects (i.e. not instances of a class other than `Object`) are cobsidered nodes.

## Configuration

The following sections detail the different ways to configure Treecle.

### Default configuration

This example shows how to use Treecle right out of the box, with the default configuration assuming that all objects are child nodes.

```js
import { find } from "treecle";

const tree = {
  value: 1,
  left: {
	value: 2,
  },
  right: {
	value: 3,
  },
};

const node = find(tree, (node) => node.value === 3);

console.log(node); // { value: 3 }
```

### Providing custom configuration

This example shows how to customize Treecle to work with a tree-like object where children are stored in an array called `children`.

```js
import Treecle, { find } from "treecle";

const tree = {
	value: 1,
	type: "root",
	children: [
		{
			type: "leaf",
			value: 2,
		},
		{
			type: "leaf",
			value: 3
		}
	]
}

// Create a new instance of Treecle with custom configuration
const treecle = new Treecle({
	getChildProperties: node => node.type === "leaf" ? [] : ["children"],
	isNode: node => Boolean(node.value)
});

const node = find.call(treecle, tree, node => node.value === 3);

console.log(node); // { type: 'leaf', value: 3 }
```

### Permanently override configuration

If your tree schema will never change, you can also choose to permanently override the configuration to avoid having to call all Treecle's functions with a context object passed in.

```js
import { find, defaults } from "treecle";

// Override the default configuration permanently
defaults.getChildProperties = node => node.type === "leaf" ? [] : ["children"];
defaults.isNode = node => Boolean(node.value);


const tree = {
	value: 1,
	type: "root",
	children: [
		{
			type: "leaf",
			value: 2,
		},
		{
			type: "leaf",
			value: 3
		}
	]
}

const node = find(tree, node => node.value === 3);

console.log(node); // { type: "leaf", value: 3 }
```

<script type=module>
// Create global variable to facilitate experimentation
import * as treecle from "./src/index.js";
globalThis.treecle = treecle;
</script>
